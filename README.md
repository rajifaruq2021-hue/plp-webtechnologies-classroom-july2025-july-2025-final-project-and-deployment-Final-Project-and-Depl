# Final Project: My Personal Portfolio Website

This is my final project for the PLP Web Development course. It is a multi-page personal portfolio website designed to showcase my skills in front-end development.

## Project Purpose and Structure

The website serves as a digital headquarters for my professional brand. It includes three main pages:
- **Home:** A welcoming landing page.
- **About:** A page describing my background and skills.
- **Contact:** A page with a functional, JavaScript-validated contact form.

The project is structured with organized folders for CSS (`/css`), JavaScript (`/js`), and HTML files in the root directory, following best practices for code organization.
